# Donasiku API Collection

This Postman collection, **Donasiku**, provides a set of endpoints for an application focused on managing donations, user authentication, profile management, document verification, community registration, and area/category management.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This collection is designed to be run against a local development server, as indicated by the base URL: `http://localhost:3000`.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Postman:** You need the Postman application (or a compatible tool) to import and run this collection.
2.  **Running Backend:** The backend server for Donasiku must be running locally on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Setup

1.  **Import:** Import the `Donasiku.postman_collection.json` file into your Postman workspace.
2.  **Environment Variables:**
    * The collection uses a variable named `{{accessToken}}` for authorization.
    * After successfully executing the **Login** request, you should set the received **JWT (JSON Web Token)** as the value for the `accessToken` variable in your environment or collection variables to use it in subsequent protected requests.

## üõ†Ô∏è To Do / Next Steps

1.  Ensure an active environment is selected with a valid `accessToken` variable.
2.  Test the **Login** request first and save the returned token to the `accessToken` variable.
3.  Fill in required form data and file paths for all requests using `formdata` (e.g., in **Update Profile** and **Donatur Posting Items**).
4.  Replace placeholder IDs in paths (like `2` in `/documents/documents/2/verify` or `1` in `/donate/items/1/status`) with dynamic values or valid IDs from your database.
